# store-functions

Common CLIs packaged with a HTTP interface

About these functions:

* They are multi-arch - for `armhf`, `arm64` and `x86_64`
* They are built with `faas-cli`
* They are built and published to GHCR as container images to avoid the Docker Hub's rate limits

## Using the functions

### With OpenFaaS

You can deploy them through openfaas on Kubernetes, or openfaas on a VM with [faasd](https://github.com/openfaas/faasd).

```bash
faas-cli store deploy curl

faas-cli store deploy nodeinfo

faas-cli deploy --image ghcr.io/openfaas/alpine:latest \
  --name env --fprocess="env"
```

Example usage:

```bash
faas-cli store deploy nmap
echo -n "-sP 192.168.0.0/24" faas-cli invoke nmap
```

### With Docker

Or run them ad-hoc with Docker:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 --name hey \
  -d ghcr.io/openfaas/hey:latest

curl http://127.0.0.1:8080 -d "-c 5 -n 1000 https://your-service.com/"
```

## Included functions

* `alpine` - a base for running built-in bash or busybox commands like `env` (use it to debug headers) or `wc -l` to count text within a body
* `curl` - debug outgoing networking or internal services
* `dig` - debug DNS resolution from inside your cluster
* `figlet` - print ASCII logso
* `hey` - run a load-test against a HTTP API, website, or function with [hey](https://github.com/rakyll/hey)
* `nmap` - scan a network range
* `nodeinfo` - debug auto-scaling, find the container's memory, CPU information and uptime
* `sleep` - debug timeouts or async by sleeping for a set duration
* `sentimentanalysis` - use Python's textblob library to find out if a statement is positive or negative
* `shasum` - generate a SHA for a given input

Other functions: `imagemagick`, `ffmpeg`.
